What do I expect from 2016? Ok, short and again as a short list.

- Game Development
 - Finish at least 2 little games. Ship these games! Technology? Don't know yet.
- Musik
 - Keep it going with a band. And as a little challenge: Learn playing Blues Harp.
- More Hiking and/or Biking and in line with it: More Geocaching.
- Public Speaking
 - I'll focus on one or two talks at Barcamps or something similar. Maybe one commercial Conference.
- Writing
 - Writing more Blog posts, articles etc. Maybe just for me, but just more writing!
