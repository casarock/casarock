Here are my three most important things I’ve learned in October 2017

1. In October I’ve started reading [#BusyBusy written by Tony Crabbe](https://www.amazon.de/BusyBusy-Stresse-dich-nicht-lebe/dp/3593507595/) and the book inspired me a lot. I’ve started to change my life at work and private. Getting a step back from _Getting all things done_ to _Get important things done_. I’ve learned to deactivate my mail notifications and to attend only meetings which have an agenda and where I am really needed. There are many more great things you can do to stop being busy without being a lazy guy at work ;) Give this book a try! It’s really inspiring.
2. While I was traveling to Munich for giving a talk about [Why open matters](https://casa-rock.de/talk/ijs_keynote-open-matters_2017/) I got a call by the conference organisers. Their keynote speaker had a pneumonia and they thought my topic may also work as a keynote. I did it. And it was frightening, great and a challenge. My keynote wasn’t perfect and I was very nervous. But I think it was ok. At least I had some fun and it was a big step forward giving talks.
3. Sometimes you have to step back and let someone else do something. You couldn’t help everywhere. Recognising this moment is something I definitely have to learn much more. But I did a first baby step.
