# Recap? Ok, but short and as a list!

- [Public Speaking](http://casa-rock.de/talks) 
 - I had the pleasure speaking at seven conferences and one Barcamp. I visited Berlin, Munich, Mainz (Mayence) and Nuremberg.
- Job
 - What a ride. Ups and downs, but always fun. 2016 will rock...
- Game Development
 - Started at least two little projects. None of them finished. I'm still at HTML5-Games with [Phaser](http://phaser.io). 2016 I want to dive into something new. Maybe [LÃ¶ve](http://love2d.org) or [Unity](http://unity3d.com). We will see.
 - Found some people who want to make a "bigger" game. First meetings were promising. I hope we get some traction.
- Music
 - At the end of 2015 I've found a little band searching for a Bass-Player. Covering some Rolling Stones! So far I like it. But more than three years of not playing an instrument requires some more practicing.
- Family
 - Couldn't be better ;)
